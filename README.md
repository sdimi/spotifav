After I found out that I have access to some interesting features (danceability, loudness etc) on my Spotify playlists, I decided to crunch some numbers in order to discover patterns on my favorite songs. For reality check, I compared my songs with the [Today's Top Hits](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/5FJXhjdILmRA2z5bvz4nzf) playlist, leading to some fun observations. You can get the aforementioned features for your playlists by this clever [Echonest app](http://static.echonest.com/SortYourMusic/).

This repository contains the necessary code, data, and Jupyter Notebooks to estimate histograms, correlation heatmaps, dimensionality reduction and visualization with t-SNE and outlier detection with One-Class SVM visualized in contour plots. 

To run you should set up the usual sci-Python gang: Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Sklearn. 

### Steps
1. Log in to [Echonest app](http://static.echonest.com/SortYourMusic/) and choose your playlist.
2. Copy the table to a spreadsheet.
3. Save it as csv.
4. Run ``spotify_favorites.py`` to find correlations and estimate t-SNE and SVM
5. Comment out [line 196](https://github.com/sdimi/spotifav/blob/master/spotify_favorites.py#L196) to draw a projection of a specific artist.
6. Run ``today_top_hits.py`` to compare step's 4. data with today top hits.

As an alternative, you can query your playlists through the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/), getting access to even more features. Let me know how did that go.
